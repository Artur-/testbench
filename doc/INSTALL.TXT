Setting up Firefox for recording a test case
============================================
1. Install Vaadin TestBench IDE (inside .zip package)
2. Open Vaadin TestBench IDE in FireFox (Tools -> Vaadin TestBench IDE) and record.

Setting up a test host
======================
1. Install Selenium RC 1.0.1 (http://seleniumhq.org/download/).
2. Extract Vaadin Selenium Core Extensions (selenium-extensions/core/user-extensions.js)
3. Start the Selenium Server using the "-userExtensions path-to-extensionsjs/user-extensions.js" parameter, e.g.
"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" -jar c:\selenium\selenium-remote-control-1.0-beta-2\selenium-server-1.0-beta-2\selenium-server.jar -userExtensions C:\selenium\user-extensions.js"

Make sure the size of a maximized window will always be the same.
- In windows: Do not use the auto-hide function of the toolbar. It will popup up and down when least expected. 
  Note that locking the toolbar will change the resolution of the browser so either lock it or keep it unlocked 
  but changing it will require regeneration of screenshots.

Disable error reporting in case Internet Explorer (or another browser) crashes:
1. Open control panel -> System
2. Select the "Advanced" tab
3. Select "Error reporting"
4. Make sure "Disable error reporting" is selected
5. Make sure the "But notify me when critical errors occur" is not checked

Turn off all software that may unexpectedly pop up new windows.

Turn off popup blockers in all browsers
- Internet Explorer: Tools -> Pop-up blocker -> Turn Off Pop-up Blocker
- Safari: Settings -> Block Pop-up Windows 

Start all browsers at least once to make sure no "Do you want to set this browser as the default" appears.


Set Selenium Server to start up automatically (Windows)
1. Create a shortcut in the startup folder to the selenium server, e.g. 
"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" -jar c:\selenium\selenium-remote-control-1.0-beta-2\selenium-server-1.0-beta-2\selenium-server.jar -userExtensions C:\selenium\user-extensions.js"
