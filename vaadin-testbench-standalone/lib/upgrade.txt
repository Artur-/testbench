Notes on the included Selenium Grid version:


Upgrade steps (to check):
- update selenium.version in vaadin-testbench/pom.xml and
  vaadin-testbench-standalone/pom.xml (dependency-reduced-pom.xml is generated
  from it)
- update phantomjsdriver version in vaadin-testbench/pom.xml if necessary
- add selenium JARs to lib/org/seleniumhq/selenium/selenium-standalone/[version]
  - this is a local Maven repository as the grid components are not in Maven
  - the main JAR can downloaded from http://seleniumhq.org/ and renamed
    from selenium-server-standalone-[version].jar to
    selenium-standalone-[version].jar
  - the POM for it can be copied from the previous version and version
    number in it updated
  - the sources JAR is more problematic as it is not distributed by
    SeleniumHQ; it should contain the sources for the packages
    - org.openqa.grid
    - org.openqa.selenium
    - com.thoughtworks.selenium
    - use the following commands in a checkout of the selenium server project
      to create such a JAR:
      cd selenium/java/server/src
      jar cvf ../../../../selenium-standalone-2.37.0-sources.jar org/openqa/selenium/ org/openqa/grid
      cd ../../client/src
      jar uvf ../../../../selenium-standalone-2.37.0-sources.jar org/openqa/selenium/ com/thoughtworks/
- remove old Selenium standalone version
- update maven-metadata-local.xml (last update date and versions)
- update all dependency versions in doc/releasenotes.html

Note that upgrading Selenium for the recorder requires a separate set of steps
that is not documented yet.
